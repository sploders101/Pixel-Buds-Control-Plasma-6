# Pixel Buds Pro Control

This is a KDE applet designed to be used with [pbpctrl](https://github.com/qzed/pbpctrl)
to provide a convenient status bar applet for the Pixel Buds Pro, similar to what you
might get with AirPods on Mac OS.


## Prerequisites

This applet relies on [pbpctrl](https://github.com/qzed/pbpctrl) to function. On arch linux,
it can be installed from the AUR as `pbpctrl`.


## Installation

Installation is fairly straightforward. From the Github page, click "Code" -> "Download ZIP"
and save the file. Then, right click your panel, choose "Show Panel Configuration", and go to
"Add or Manage Widgets". Click "Get New", then "Install Widget From Local File", and pick the
zip file you just downloaded. The applet should be available to put on your panel!
